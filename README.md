This is a kit for quickly create a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app with [TailwindCC](https://tailwindcss.com/) already installed.

## Getting Started

You can clone this starting kit by running* 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Antoine-Bollinger/kit_nextjs_tailwindcc .
```
directly in the folder of your great project.

Then run :
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```
to install all the dependencies and finally :
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
will run the development server.

* Note the dot at the end of the command, this allows you to clone directly into the folder without creating a subfolder named after the repo.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Editing

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
